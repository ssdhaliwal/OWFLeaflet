# OWFLeaflet
Project to use Leaflet as map component under OWF.

## LeafletJS is a fast projection renderer and works with multiple map servers.  The project will implement CMAPI 1.3 and modified channels to see if LeafletJS can support thousands of markers on front-end.
### Support of geoJSON and KML 2.2 on the front-end is required.

### First Steps
1. Build a basic Leaflet OWF widget with CMAPI channels which can be supported from the published events in Leaflet.
2. Work on KML to JSON.Object converter.
3. Work on geoJSON to JSON.Object mapping.
4. Render markers based on CMAPI feature layer options.

### Follow-on items
5. (continually in work once 1-4 are done)
